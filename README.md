# Portfolio

This repo hosts my Github pages blog/portfolio. All the file contained in this repo have been generating using Python and Pelican on my local machine. When I am developing the site, I am work in "dev" branch of this repo. You can find all the backend Pelican and Python files that generated this site on this "dev" branch. When I completed the change to the site, I push only the website content to the master branch. If you would like to visit my site, please visit kavisekhon.com. If you are interested in learning how I generated this site,  please check out the links below, there are some excellent references. Note, I have modified my Pelican config file, theme, and file system dramatically from this blog post. Therefore, I would recommend you also check out Pelican's documentation as well.
